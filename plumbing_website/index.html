      <p class="section-intro">Sewer line problems are stressful and expensive—but they don't have to be a nightmare. Free-Flow Plumbing has handled hundreds of sewer line replacements throughout Pasco, Pinellas, and Hernando counties with professionalism, honesty, and clean workmanship.</p>

      <div class="sewer-content">
        <div class="sewer-info">
          <h3>Why Sewer Lines Fail (And Why You Need an Expert)</h3>
          <p>Your sewer line is buried underground, so you don't think about it—until it fails. Tree roots, ground shifting, old cast iron pipes, and Florida's unique soil conditions can all cause sewer lines to crack, collapse, or clog. When that happens, you need someone with excavation equipment, experience, and the skills to do it right.</p>

          <h3>Warning Signs You Need Sewer Line Service</h3>
          <ul class="warning-signs">
            <li>Frequent backups or slow drains throughout the house</li>
            <li>Gurgling sounds from toilets or drains</li>
            <li>Sewage odors in your yard or home</li>
            <li>Patches of unusually green or soggy grass</li>
            <li>Multiple plumbing fixtures backing up at once</li>
            <li>Foundation cracks or unexplained settling</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How Free-Flow Handles Sewer Line Replacements</h3>
          <ul class="process-list">
            <li><strong>Camera Inspection:</strong> We start with a video inspection to pinpoint the exact problem—roots, breaks, corrosion, offset joints, or complete collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear, Honest Estimate:</strong> You'll get an upfront, detailed quote with no hidden fees. We explain what needs to be done and why.</li>
            <li><strong>Permit Handling:</strong> We obtain all necessary permits and ensure the work meets Florida plumbing code.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Excavation:</strong> We have our own excavation equipment and know how to minimize disruption to your landscaping.</li>
