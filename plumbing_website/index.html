          <h3>Why Sewer Lines Matter</h3>
          <p>Your sewer line is one of the most critical—and overlooked—parts of your plumbing system. When it fails, it can cause sewage backups, foundation damage, and costly emergency repairs. That's why we've made sewer line replacement a key specialty.</p>

          <h3>Warning Signs You Need Sewer Line Service</h3>
          <ul class="warning-signs">
            <li>Frequent drain backups or slow drains throughout the house</li>
            <li>Gurgling sounds from toilets or drains</li>
            <li>Sewage odors in your yard or basement</li>
            <li>Patches of unusually green or soggy grass in the yard</li>
            <li>Multiple plumbing fixtures backing up at once</li>
            <li>Foundation cracks or settling</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Our Sewer Line Process</h3>
          <ul class="process-list">
            <li><strong>Camera Inspection:</strong> We start with a video inspection to pinpoint the exact problem—roots, breaks, corrosion, or collapse.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Estimate:</strong> You'll get an upfront, detailed quote with no hidden fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Permit Handling:</strong> We obtain all necessary permits and ensure the work meets local code.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Excavation:</strong> We minimize disruption to your landscaping and restore the site when we're done.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Materials:</strong> Modern, durable pipe materials designed to last decades.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> We test everything and walk you through the completed work.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="sewer-cta-text">Sewer line replacement is a significant investment, but it protects your home's value and your family's health. We treat every job with the care and expertise it deserves.</p>
